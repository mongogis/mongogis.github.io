Right now, core mumbers in the MongoGIS group are from [Nanjing University](http://gis.nju.edu.cn/) in China, [CIGI Lab](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/) in NCSA, MongoDB Geospatial Group and Open source GIS communities. We are recruiting people from all over the world to work together to build the new generation infrastructure for GIS communities.
