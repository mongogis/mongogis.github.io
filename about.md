Right now, core mumbers in the MongoGIS group are from [Nanjing University](http://gis.nju.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, [CIGI Lab](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/), NCSA, UIUC, USA, and developers in the 10gen and Open source GIS communities. We are recruiting people from all over the world to work together to build the new generation infrastructure for GIS communities.
